Here are some files that might be useful for users of the library:

 99-psmove.rules:
 Copy this files to /etc/udev/rules.d/ on Linux machines with udev
 to make sure that the PS Move controller can be accessed via USB
 by any user on the system (otherwise you might get a permission
 problem or you might have to run the application as root).

 bluez-register-psmove:
 This adds the relevant profile and SDP entries to the bluetoothd
 state files in /var/lib/bluetooth/ (bluetoothd mustn't be running)
 so that a PS Move controller (also works for Sixaxis) can connect
 as HID device without problems.

 create_move.py:
 This is a less intrusive variant of the above "bluez-register-move"
 script. It uses D-Bus to communicate with bluetoothd and tells it
 to add a Move Controller to the system. If that works, the device
 is set as Trusted, so that bluetoothd will accept connections from
 the Move Controller. It might still be necessary to restart Bluez
 after this script has been run, but it won't tamper with the state
 files directly.

 Android.mk:
 Example makefile for use with the Android NDK and/or agcc. Can be
 used to cross-compile the example application to run on a rooted
 Android device, also using bluez-register-psmove.
